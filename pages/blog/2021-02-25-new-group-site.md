## Welcome to the SHFT Website

After way more time spent than I'd like to admit, the new SHFT site is now live. We'll be using this site to catalog and archive all the group's work. 

The site has multiple sections and is completely statically generated, which means that pages load fast, are easy to preserve and use minimal computing power.

Our group is currently engaged in a number of different ongoing research projects in software history and preservation. I, Eric, will also use this space to post updates on current projects and other thoughts related to group work. My research associates will also likely post about their work from time to time.

Please check out the [about page] for more information on the group.
