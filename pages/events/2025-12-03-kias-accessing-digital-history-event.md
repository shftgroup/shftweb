This two-day workshop brings together Canadian and international researchers, archivists, librarians, and digital 
preservation practitioners to address the critical challenges surrounding the creation of national infrastructure for 
preserving software-based digital media works in Canada. Funded by the Kule Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) at the 
University of Alberta, the workshop focuses on collaborative approaches to ensure long-term access to born-digital and 
complex media works.

The workshop is structured around key themes essential to building sustainable preservation infrastructure:

**Day 1: Alignment and Sharing** provides a foundation for collaboration through introductions from participating institutions 
and projects, including National Indigenous Media Arts Coalition (NIMAC), Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN), 
the Software Preservation Network, OCADU's Inclusive Design Research Centre, UAlberta's Software 
History Futures and Technologies (SHFT) Group and Critical Research Yielding Playful Technologies (CRYPT), 
Queen's University's Vulnerable Media Lab. Participants will explore current preservation technologies like GISST and 
EAASI, discuss Canadian cultural contexts and networks of care, and examine the legal landscape specific to Canadian 
copyright and cultural policy.

**Day 2: Workshop** emphasizes collaborative planning and output generation. Sessions will be determined based on Day 1 
discussions, with potential focus on grant formation working groups, and concrete next steps for advancing preservation 
infrastructure.

Key topics include:
- Emulation and preservation technologies for complex media
- Networks of care and Canadian cultural contexts
- Post-colonial and custodial models in access negotiation
- Canadian copyright law and policy frameworks
- Prioritization and collaboration strategies
- Partnership opportunities and future project formation

The workshop takes place at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, providing an inspiring setting for participants 
to develop collaborative relationships, share knowledge across institutions, and establish concrete pathways forward 
for Canadian digital media preservation infrastructure.
