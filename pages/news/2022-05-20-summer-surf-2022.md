This summer three Research Associates, Morgan McMurray, Adam Larson, and Desire√© Caldera will help to investigate and develop methodologies for the use of the EaaSI system in recovering historical development environments. CI's Summer [SURF] program is providing funding. We will also investigate using EaaSI for other classes of artifacts held in CI's University Library collections.
