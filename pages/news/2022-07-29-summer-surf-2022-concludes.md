This years SURF co-hort, consisting of Desire√© Caldera, Adam Larson, and Morgan McMurray
have completed this year's SURF supported work in the use of emulation to retrieve legacy projects and files.
The students worked for two months configuring emulated systems, researching archaic installation procedures,
and meticulous documenting their workflows. This resulted in the configuration of emulated environments to
support legacy projects from the [ETC Data Set Analysis] as well as items contributed by CI's University Library.

Student work on this project also informed Dr. Kaltman's NSF CAREER grant submission on emulation workflows.
