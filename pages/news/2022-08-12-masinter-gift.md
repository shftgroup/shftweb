Dr. Larry Masinter, a renowned computer science researcher responsible for some of the 
earliest integrated graphical user interfaces (among other things), has made a $5,000 donation to the SHFT lab.
The gift is targeted at supporting student assistants to collaborate with Dr. Masinter's
Interlisp.org. Interlisp Medley was the first integrated window, mouse, and graphical user
interface (GUI). Dr. Masinter and a team of volunteers are working on improvements to a emulator for the system and 
currently have it running for use in web browsers.

Interlisp.org is a 501c(3) non-profit devoted to the support and continued development of the Interlisp emulator.
Students from CI will help the project migrate to new development environments and organize
documentation for using the emulated system.
