Continuing from last year, SHFT is participating in CSUCI's HSI-SMART initiative. HSI-SMART is an NSF-funded 
five-year program to improve graduation rates through undergraduate research mentorship. SHFT is hosting four
students: [Adam Larson], [Matilda Orona], Kimberley Soriano, and Evan Jacobs. Students will work on a variety of 
SHFT projects, including project file visualization, flash preservation, and perspectives on personal game
archiving.
