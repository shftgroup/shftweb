On October 15th, 2022 the Het Nieuwe Instituut (the Netherlands national museum for architecture, design, and digital culture) published an in-depth report on the challenges of managing born-digital architectural records. SHFT founder, Dr. Eric Kaltman, provided input into the project through an interview with the report's primary author Ania Molenda. Dr. Kaltman is quoted in the publication due to his experience with interactive project design records. The full report, <i>Understanding Digital Architecture</i>, can be found on [the museum's website](https://collectie.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/preservation/understanding-digital-architecture)
