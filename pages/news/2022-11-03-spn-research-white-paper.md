The long-gestating report on general issues in software preservation for service providers has been released by the Software Preservation Network's Research-in-Practice working group. Dr. Kaltman was an early member of this group when the white paper project was proposed. He left the group before work formally started but did provide draft input on the publication. It is an important work delimiting a number of challenges related to software preservation, including representation and inclusion, software preservation education, and the needs of service providers. The full report, <i>Supporting Software Preservation Services in Research and Memory Institutions</i> is [downloadable from SPN's website](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/supporting-software-preservation-services-in-research-and-memory-organizations/)
