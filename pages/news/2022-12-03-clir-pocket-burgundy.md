Lab PI, Dr. Eric Kaltman, was selected for a [CLIR Pocket Burgundy Award](https://www.clir.org/pocket-burgundies/) along with the Software Preservation Network Technological Infrastructure Working Group to write a short report entitled, "An Overview of Emulation as a Preservation Method." The goal of this CLIR program is to provide reports on emerging or important advances for libraries. CLIR will work to disseminate the report when it is published in 2024.
