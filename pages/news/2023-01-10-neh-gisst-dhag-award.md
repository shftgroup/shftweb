Dr. Eric Kaltman, SHFT founder, and [Dr. Joseph C. Osborn] of Pomona College have received a joint grant from the 
[National Endowment for the Humanities] to continue work on the [Game and Interactive Scholarship Toolkit] (GISST). This
$146,000 was provided by the NEH's Digital Humanities Advancement Grant (DHAG) program, and provides project funding
through the end of 2024. The grant is a Level II Implementation grant, and the goal is to apply for a follow-on
project toward the end of 2024. Students at CI and Pomona will support the grant work through testing and game play
file generation.
