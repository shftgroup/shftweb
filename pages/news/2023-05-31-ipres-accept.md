The SHFT Group submitted two papers to iPRES 2023, "Tacit Processes: Qualitative Analysis Toward Bottom-Up Emulation Workflows"
and "Investigating the Effects of Adobe Flash Deprecation on Online Preservation Efforts". The former short paper 
has been accepted for presentation at iPRES 2023 at the University of Illinois in September 2023. 

SHFT research associates [Adam Larson] and [Matilda Orona] helped with each paper respectively. While the Flash paper
did not get accepted, its reviews were all positive, and SHFT is working on further amendments and resubmission to a
different venue.
