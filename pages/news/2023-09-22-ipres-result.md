Our paper "Tacit Processes: Qualitative Analysis Toward Bottom-Up Emulation Workflows" was nominated for the Anna Dappert
award for Research and Practice in Digital Preservation at iPRES 2023. The reviewers noted the innovation in the use of qualitative
grounded theory toward preservation workflows. We are just super excited that everyone liked the work!
