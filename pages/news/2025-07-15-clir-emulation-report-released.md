The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) has published "[An Overview of Emulation as a Preservation Method]," co-authored by Dr. Eric Kaltman and five other members of the Software Preservation Network's Technological Infrastructure Working Group. The report is the latest addition to CLIR's Pocket Burgundy series and represents a comprehensive guide for cultural heritage professionals considering emulation strategies.

Co-authored with Winnie Schwaid-Lindner (Louisiana State University Libraries), Drey Jonathan, Andrew Borman (Strong National Museum of Play), Alex Garnett (Simon Fraser University), and Larry Masinter (Interlisp.org), the report introduces fundamental concepts related to emulation in practice and explains key considerations for sound decision-making about when to employ emulation techniques.

The publication addresses a growing need within libraries, archives, museums, and galleries as they face challenging decisions about preserving digital collections. "Emulation makes it possible to interact with historical data and digital artifacts in ways that are more consistent with creators' intentions, helping contemporary users better understand digital works in their original context," the report explains.

A key motivation for the work was accessibility. "A driving motivation of this Pocket Burgundy is to make emulation more approachable and accessible to people across GLAM [galleries, libraries, archives, and museums], especially those without deep technical backgrounds," notes co-author Winnie Schwaid-Lindner.

The report includes a comprehensive review of academic literature related to emulation and suggests new avenues for future exploration, providing both newcomers and experienced practitioners with current state-of-the-art understanding. The work builds on several years of documentation and insight-sharing by the Software Preservation Network's working group, aimed at establishing best practices for scalable infrastructure solutions.

The publication is available as a free digital download on [CLIR's website] as part of their commitment to making preservation knowledge accessible to the broader cultural heritage community.
