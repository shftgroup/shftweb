Based on a generous act by the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at
Carnegie Mellon University, this project's goal is the 
characterization and exploration of an 18TB data set of 
all ETC's past projects. ETC is a world-leading interactive
arts program, with students completing prototypical projects
for a range of CMU-local, non-profit, and industry clients.
ETC provided SHFT with a back up of their projects to see 
if there are ways to leverage historical project data for
current projects, and to provide a more engaging history of
the program for their current students.

As noted below, there are currently two publications on the
project. SHFT's summer undergraduate research fellowship (SURF)
cohort worked with this dataset through summer 2021. Their 
efforts formed the basis for continued investigations of the
data through SHFT's complementary [data visualization] project.

The ETC analysis organized a "content profile" of around 10
million files in the dataset, which derived file format
metadata from the larger collection. The metadata is now 
searchable through a local MySQL (and SQLite) instance.
