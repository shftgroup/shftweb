Adobe Flash was a platform for web animation and interactive projects 
from 1996-2020. With the discontinuation of support for Flash
at the end of 2020 numerous efforts arose to preservation 
Flash projects and early interactive web history. This project is attempting to
describe the efforts made to preserve Flash games and applications by the hobbyist preservation 
community. It is also looking at the effects of Flash's discontinuation across sectors, as
Flash is currently still functioning in mainland China for a variety of use cases.

The goal of this work is a series of publications on the state of Flash preservation
and what it portends for the coming deprecation of other systems.
