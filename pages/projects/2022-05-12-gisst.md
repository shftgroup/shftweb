The Game and Interactive Software Scholarship Toolkit (GISST) is a system for citing the run-time
state of computer game emulators and retrieving those states in a web browser. It was co-created
with Dr. Joseph C. Osborn of Pomona College in 2015-2017. GISST developed out
of the Game and Metadata Citation Project (GAMECIP) and resulted in numerous publications, including
an interactive example in Digital Humanities Quarterly in 2021. 

Currently, the GISST project is on hiatus pending further grant support. If support comes through, a new
version of the system will be developed during the 2023-2025 interval.
