Interlisp.org is a 501c(3) non-profit founded by Dr. Larry Masinter to support the development and recovery of 
an emulator for the Medley Interlisp system. Interlisp was developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970s and released as
the first mouse-driven, windowed GUI interface. The Interlisp.org project has updated the original Interlisp 
emulator to work within a Docker container accessible from a common web browser. 

Thanks to a generous gift from Dr. Masinter, SHFT research associates are working with the Interlisp.org team
to organize documentation for the emulator and help with its deployment to different historical environments.
One goal is to try and get Interlisp running with the EaaSI distributed emulation system. 

The current workplan is for a single research associated to interface with the Interlisp.org team for the 2022-2023
academic year.
