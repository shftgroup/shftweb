[Interlisp.org] is a 501c(3) non-profit founded by [Dr. Larry Masinter] to support the development and recovery of an emulator for the Medley Interlisp system. Interlisp was developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970s and released as the first mouse-driven, windowed GUI interface. The Interlisp.org project has updated the original Interlisp emulator to work within a Docker container accessible from a common web browser as well as in a WebAssembly native form. 

Thanks to a generous gift from Dr. Masinter, SHFT research associates are working with the Interlisp.org team to organize documentation for the emulator and help with its deployment to different historical environments. One goal is to try and get Interlisp running with the EaaSI distributed emulation system. 

The current work plan is for a couple graduate research associates to interface with the Interlisp.org team for the spring and summer of 2024.
