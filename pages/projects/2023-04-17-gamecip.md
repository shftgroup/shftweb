As computer and video games and general software have worked their way into library collections over the past few decades, cataloging standards and collection management practices have not adequately kept up. The [Game Metadata and Citation Project] (GAMECIP), was a collaboration between the University Libraries at Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), that aimed to relieve confusion in library records that describe game software and helped to ensure better access to legacy software through authority control and guidelines for game cataloging and citation. SHFT is now working on updating and reviving the GAMECIP controlled vocabularies for game platforms and media formats. These vocabularies are used in library catalog records to provide canonical references to specific game hardware and software requirements. 

The goal of the current work is to update and future-proof the semantic web endpoint for the GAMECIP vocabularies. The [predecessor] website, www.gamemetadata.org, has not received updates for a few years, and the current work will transition the site from a Drupal 8 instance to a statically generated one. Improvements will include better navigation and user experience as well as more efficient submission of vocabulary terms through Github pull requests and issues.
