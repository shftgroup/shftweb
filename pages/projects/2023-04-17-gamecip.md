As computer and video games and general software have worked their way into library collections over the past few decades, cataloging standards and collection management practices have not adequately kept up. The [Game Metadata and Citation Project] GAMECIP, a collaboration between the University Libraries at Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), is aimed at relieving confusion in library records that describe game software and helping ensure better access to legacy software through authority control and guidelines for game cataloging and citation.

Launched in 2015, the project continues to evolve in its mission to improve cataloging standards and collection management practices for computer and video games, as well as general software in library collections. After two previous iterations of the website, the above mentioned and it's [predecessor], we are now embarking on developing a third iteration to further enhance user experience and accessibility. In this latest version, we aim to facilitate more efficient updates and maintenance of the library by enabling user contributions through GitHub.
