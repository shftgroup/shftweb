# Abstract
This paper presents an abbreviated summary of previous work
using a distributed emulation network (EaaSI) to allow for the
analysis of computer assisted design (CAD) tools including multiple
versions of the popular AutoCAD system. It elaborates on the use of
EaaSI in a graduate seminar on the history of computational design,
presenting a design pedagogy use case for archived software objects
and showing how their remediation through emulation can lead to
new historical and design insights into contemporary software. It
includes further clarification on the relevance of emulation to the
archival community and highlights extended use cases not found in
the original publication.
