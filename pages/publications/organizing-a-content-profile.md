# Abstract
This paper details the organization of a "content profile" of a large longitudinal collection of interactive project prototypes of singular provenance. A content profile aims to analyze and summarize aggregate file metadata associated with a collection to aid in digital preservation strategies. Here, we detail the qualitative and quantitative methods used to organize a profile of a 14TB data set containing around 10.5 million files and 5,000 file extensions. The work extends the use of a content profile toward the historical characterization and interpretation of software development records. Additionally, the work prefigures further challenges associated with historical analysis of large, interdisciplinary data sets.
