The Unity Scanner was developed by Masters Student Jonathan Jenkins to allow for the quick perusal of legacy
Unity Engine projects. Unity is an industry-standard interactive game and experience creation application that has
not received much preservation scrutiny. The system is frequently updated with breaking changes, and maintaining
legacy projects is a known hassle. The Unity Scanner is intended for use by archives and scholars to explore
the contents of Unity projects without the need for a compatible version of the Unity software. The scanner can
also help determine which version of the software would be needed to recover a project as well as what other
dependencies it contains. 

The Unity Scanner was evaluated by users in the library space, and those results (along with a full description of
the application) can be found in Jenkin's thesis.
