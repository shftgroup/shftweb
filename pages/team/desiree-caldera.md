**Desiree Caldera** is a graduate of the Computer Science program at California State 
University Channel Islands. She pursued a bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
along with a minor in Math and a minor in Chicanx Studies. She chose to major in 
Computer Science to make lives easier through technology. 

As she completed her academic career she had the opportunity to apply her skills 
outside the classroom. 
In the summer of 2021, she was assigned to a CWL team to develop an online cybersecurity monitoring platform for web applications
and wireless networks. In summer 2022, her and a team of fellow research associates configured and evaluated the execution of 
legacy software environments in the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) System. 
She is excited for the challenges and learning experiences she'll encounter in the working world.
