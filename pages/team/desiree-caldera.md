**Desiree Caldera** is an undergraduate at California State University Channel Islands. She is pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science along with a minor in Math and a minor in Chicanx Studies. She has chosen to major in Computer Science to make lives easier through technology. 

As she completes her academic career she has had the opportunity to apply her skills outside the classroom. 
Last summer, she was assigned to a CWL team to develop an online cybersecurity monitoring platform for web applications
and wireless networks. This summer, her and a team of fellow research associates will configure and evaluate the execution of 
legacy software environments in the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) System. 
She is excited for the challenges and learning experiences she'll encounter this summer.
