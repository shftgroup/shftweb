Jeongmin "Min" Ahn is a graduate of California State University Channel Islands with a B.S. in Computer Science. 

She is an aspiring game developer with a strong passion for most things game related.
Her most respected hero is Satoru Iwata, the legend himself.

Min served her time as a research associate and her only hope is that she made life slightly easier for those helping the project after her. Her major contribution was the initial project listing information for the Entertainment Technology Center's Data Analysis Project. She mined information for hundreds of projects and contributed a script that helped with file directory search and cleaning.
