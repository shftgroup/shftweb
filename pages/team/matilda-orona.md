Matilda Orona holds a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from [California State University Channel Islands]. 

As part of SHFT’s 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 HSI-SMART cohorts, her research examined the impact of Adobe Flash deprecation on web preservation and explored the broader implications of regional software deprecation, focusing on how heterogeneous digital artifacts can be represented and analyzed across evolving technological environments. She also contributed to [GAMECIP](https://www.shft.group/pages/projects/2023-04-17-gamecip/), a collaboration between Stanford and UCSC, where she helped refine controlled vocabularies used to improve how video games and software are cataloged and preserved in institutional collections.

Matilda is currently pursuing a Master of Information and Data Science at the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/).
